# myKitchen_cs441

Overview: I'm developing this app to allow people to keep track of the food in an individual's kitchen. This app will contain multiple views, each with it's own purpose.

1. Fridge - Lists out all food items in the user's refridgerator.
  - The user can add/edit items to the fridge
2. Recipes - Lists out user added recipes
  - User must add recipes to the list
3. Shopping List - Shows food items the user wants to purchase on their next shopping trip

The app makes use of the BottomNavigationView to switch between fragments, where each fragment will display the Fridge, Recipes, and ShopingList respectively. Dialog boxes were used to allow for easy adding/editting of items.
