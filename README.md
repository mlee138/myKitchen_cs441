Overview: I'm developing this app to allow people to keep track of the food in an individual's kitchen. This app will contain multiple views, each with it's own purpose.

1. Fridge - Lists out all food items in the user's refridgerator.
  - The user can add items to the fridge
  - The user can add quantities and nutritional facts
2. Recipes - Lists out user added recipes
  - User must add recipes to the list
  - "Use Recipe" button will automatically take out the quantities within the recipe out of your Fridge.
3. Shopping List - Shows food items the user wants to purchase on their next shopping trip
  - The user can make adding easier by adding recipes to the list.
